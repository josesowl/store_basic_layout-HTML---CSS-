This is a basic layout for a online store using HTML and CSS 

- it does not need frameworks and libraries to run the code, only need a ethernet connection to see de HTML files with their respective CSS styles

- this is only the visual part for another project, where i am going to create the engine page using back-end code

 In templates we´re gonna find all the HTML templates like a page menu or a shopping cart model

 there are about 15 templates to explore

 ## What is "Style"
 In Style we´re gonna find all the CSS file, the CSS file provide styles and colors to templates

 it works from the label classes
