# Basic Layout for online store
This is a basic layout for a online store using HTML and CSS 

- the intention of this repository is to make use of visual tools like HTML and CSS for this reason the code is not optimized for performance and interactivity

- it does not need frameworks and libraries to run the code, only need a ethernet connection to see de HTML files with their respective CSS styles at browser

- this is only the visual part for another project that will be made in the future 

## What is "Templates"
 In templates we´re gonna find all the HTML templates like a page menu or a shopping cart model
